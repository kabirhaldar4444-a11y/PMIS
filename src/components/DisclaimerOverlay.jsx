                      <p>The student onboarding journey begins instantly upon checkout. As soon as a transaction clears our secure platform gateways, our backend servers trigger an Automated Admission Confirmation Notice. Students receive a digital welcome package containing their permanent user profile IDs, platform workspace access routes, and an overview map of their target educational tracks.</p>

                      <p>In strict compliance with structural risk management policies, all enrolled learners must verify their commercial profile data. Students are required to securely upload their valid identity documentation (such as government-issued photo IDs or institutional cards) to our encrypted verification portal. This step ensures that final completion documentation matches legal corporate profiles accurately.</p>

                      <p>To prevent platform identity theft, proxy testing, and transaction chargeback vectors, students must execute an automated Video KYC Verification step. Using an integrated web interface, learners record a brief, self-directed biometric identity check matching their uploaded documents. This establishes an unalterable audit trail for security purposes.</p>

Within 24 hours of successful verification, our accounting systems compile a comprehensive, legally compliant Corporate GST Invoice detailing the exact service breakdown and tax identifiers. This asset is dispatched straight to the student's billing tab for corporate tax deduction filing purposes.</p>

                      <p>Before course modules begin, our records registry generates a formal, verifiable PMI Services Enrollment Certificate.

                      <p>By completing a commercial financial transaction or registering for any independent skill-based training program on the PMI Services network domains, the user explicitly acknowledges, understands, and binds themselves to this comprehensive, non-negotiable Service Fulfillment and No-Refund Policy. PMI Services functions strictly and exclusively as an independent, asynchronous educational infrastructure platform.</p>
                      <p className="mt-2 text-amber-700 font-semibold">Independent Status Notice: PMI Services does not maintain, require, or claim any affiliation, accreditation, licensing, or oversight from any university, government institute, statutory educational body, or private educational board.

                        <li><strong>Exclusivity of Medium:</strong> All vocational training curricula are delivered solely and exclusively via pre-recorded, asynchronous video lecture modules and downloadable PDF text study workbooks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prohibition of Live Training:</strong> The platform never offers, promises, schedules, or provides any form of person-to-person instruction, live virtual classroom training, synchronous group webinars, real-time mentorship, or interactive tutor-led sessions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Binding Clause:</strong> No claims, complaints, demands, or legal petitions for refunds based on a purported lack of live human interaction or dissatisfaction with the self-guided nature of the platform will be entertained under any circumstances.</li>

                        <li><strong>Unilateral Account Revocation for Security Violations:</strong> PMI Services reserves the right to terminate any user profile instantly, without warning, and without the obligation of financial reimbursement, if backend system logs detect concurrent multi-location IP logins, data-scraping scripts, or fraudulent identity documentation during KYC protocols.</li>
                        <li><strong>Program Modification and Discontinuance Indemnity:</strong> PMI Services reserves the right to modify, adjust, update, or re-sequence any portion of its instructional modules, PDF workbooks, grading metrics, or exam platforms at any time. This does not entitle the Client to a retrofitted refund, platform credit, or course exchange.</li>
